This is a REXX script and associated tool to
add some program objects to the desktop for
Seamonkey/Thunderbird/Firefox.
Additionally, "fechg.exe" will deactivate
Innotek Font Engine for the application.
It will also allow to reactivate Innotek Font Engine
support. Run "fechg.exe" for help.
See REXX script for additional info about
support for Rich Walsh's "run!.exe".
To use: unzip all files into your Mozilla app's
main directory. Run install.cmd from this directory.

I have added the C-source/makefile for "fechg.exe"
for your information or in case you want to
build it yourself/modify it.

The usual disclaimers apply: this software is not fit
for any particular purpose. You use this 
install script/executable at your own risk. I may not be held
responsible for any damage resulting out of the use
of this install script/executable.
